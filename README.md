# Summer 23 Research Documentation

## Introduction

This documentation is split up into three sections: Tools, Website, and BCG List. "Tools" details the coding tools I have created and provided and how to use them. "Website" details the structure of the ACCEPT2 website and how to make necessary changes or additions. "BCG List" details the final process of cleaning up the BCG list.

## Tools

- table_generate.ipynb: a jupyter notebook that takes a csv and returns both an HTML and MRT table. usage documentation contained within notebook
- search.php: a template script to generate a VOTable based on a conesearch. used by table_generate.ipynb to generate unique conesearch scripts
- data: folder to drop csv files into for processing
    - globalTestFormat.csv: a csv of the ACCEPT2 global properties table, used for input
- template_generate_output: a place to output folders created by table_generate.ipynb
    - globalTestFormat: a folder automatically generated by table_generate.ipynb, named based on the csv it was generated from
        - globalTestFormat.dat: an MRT table generated from the csv by table_generate.ipynb
        - globalTestFormat.html: an html table generated from the csv by table_generate.ipynb
        - globalTestFormat.csv: a csv of the ACCEPT2 global properties table, needed for conesearch.php to work
        - conesearch.php: a php script to generate a VOTable unique to the table
