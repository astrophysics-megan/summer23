# Summer 23 Research Documentation

## Introduction

This documentation is split up into three sections: Tools, Website, and BCG List. "Tools" details the coding tools I have created and provided and how to use them. "Website" details the structure of the ACCEPT2 website and how to make necessary changes or additions. "BCG List" details the final process of cleaning up the BCG list.

## Tools

- cluster_pointers
    - cluster_pointers.ipynb: a jupyter notebook that creates an html table with the name of each cluster, its coordinates and redshift, and whether or not it has global properties, profiles, morphology, and in ACCEPT1
    - cluster_pointers.html: the outputed html table created from cluster_pointers.ipynb
- data: folder to drop csv files into for processing
    - globalTestFormat.csv: a csv of the ACCEPT2 global properties table, used for input
    - ACCEPT2_K0_and_z.csv: a csv of profile data for the clusters
    - ACCEPT1.txt: the ACCEPT1 table in ascii format
- figureset_maker
    - figureset_maker.ipynb: a jupyter notebook that is used to create an AAS figureset for each cluster. note: to work, the figuresets folder would also need to be within this folder, however to save space on this repository it has been excluded
    - figureset.txt: the outputed figureset AASTeX
- table_generate
    - table_generate.ipynb: a jupyter notebook that takes a csv and returns both an HTML and MRT table. usage documentation contained within notebook
    - search.php: a template script to generate a VOTable based on a conesearch. used by table_generate.ipynb to generate unique conesearch scripts
    - table_generate_output: a place to output folders created by table_generate.ipynb
        - globalTestFormat: a folder automatically generated by table_generate.ipynb, named based on the csv it was generated from
            - globalTestFormat.dat: an MRT table generated from the csv by table_generate.ipynb
            - globalTestFormat.html: an html table generated from the csv by table_generate.ipynb
            - globalTestFormat.csv: a csv of the ACCEPT2 global properties table, needed for conesearch.php to work
            - conesearch.php: a php script to generate a VOTable unique to the table
